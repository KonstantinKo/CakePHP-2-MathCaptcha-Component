MathCaptcha Component for CakePHP 2.

Generates a basic math equation with human phrasing to prevent automated spam.
It's still very much beatable by sophisticated spam bots but tends to prevent 99%
of a website's usual spam anyways.

Updates will be published on my [code blog](http://codefool.tumblr.com/) and/or the corresponding github repo.

Inspired by and partially based on [Jamie Nay's](https://github.com/jamienay/math_captcha_component) cakePHP 1.2 Math Captcha class.

Features:
+ differently phrased math problems
+ allows words and numbers as answer
+ built-in timer to devalidate answers that where too fast for a human
